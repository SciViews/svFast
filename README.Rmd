{svFast} is useful when you work with very large datasets (millions to billions rows). It parallelizes many math and stat functions for faster computation on those large vectors.

## Installation

You can install the development version of svFast from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("SciViews/svFast")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(svFast)
## basic example code
```

For further instructions, please, refer to the help pages at <https://www.sciviews.org/svFast/>.
